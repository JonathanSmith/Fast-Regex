This is an implementation of a Regex -> NFA -> DFA compiler in common lisp.
It compiles down to an efficient lambda which uses tagbody and go to simulate a DFA.
It can be compiled with either bytemode t or nil. 
Bytemode T allows for matching against arrays of 8 bit bytes, as would be done in a C program.
Bytemode NIL uses lisp's native string implementation, assumed to be either ascii or unicode.
Further information should be sought by reading the code (There are a lot of comments).

There may be bugs
